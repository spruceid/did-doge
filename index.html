    <p> This specification defines a DID method (did:doge) that supports DIDs
        based on the public <a href="https://dogecoin.com/">Dogecoin</a>
        blockchain. Dogecoin is an open-source is a cryptocurrency,
        blockchain, and payment system that is instant, fun, and free from
        traditional banking fees.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <section>
  <h3>Prior Work and Enhancements</h3>
  <p> We draw heavily from prior work by Christopher Allen and Kim Hamilton
      Duffy within the W3C Credentials Community Group on the <a
      href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">BTCR DID Method</a> due to
      strong architectural similarities between the Bitcoin and Dogecoin
      blockchains.</p>
  <p> However, there are some key differences that enable new
      privacy-preserving benefits. Namely, the did:doge method-specific
      identifier is the Base58Check-encoded Dogecoin address itself, allowing
      for DID usage even in the absence of any public transaction histories
      and only relying upon them for rotation events for verification methods
      and service endpoints. This specification defines the resolution of the
      did:doge method-specific identifier to an optional "genesis" transaction
      for DID document updates, which then follows the linear transaction
      history "tip" in the same style of did:btcr using "update" transactions.
  <p> In summary, while did:btcr requires a cleared transaction prior to
      first use, did:doge does not, allowing users use of decentralized
      identifiers even if they do not own cryptocurrencies.</p>

  <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
  <section>
  <h3>Doge DID Scheme</h3>
  <p> The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>doge</code>.
      A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the prefix
      <code>did:doge</code>. As per the DID specification, this string MUST be
      in lowercase.</p>
  <p> The full Doge DID scheme is defined by the following
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/std68">ABNF</a>:</p>
  <pre><code>
doge-did    = "did:doge:" address
address     = "D" 33*33base58-char
base58-char = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" /
              "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" / "J" / "K" /
              "L" / "M" / "N" / "P" / "Q" / "R" / "S" / "T" / "U" / "V" /
              "W" / "X" / "Y" / "Z" /
              "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f" / "g" / "h" / "i" / "j" /
              "k" / "m" / "n" / "o" / "p" / "q" / "r" / "s" / "t" / "u" /
              "v" / "w" / "x" / "y" / "z"
  </code></pre>
  <p> All Doge DID method-specific identifiers are Dogecoin addresses,
      which are Base58Check encoded P2PKH and P2SH prefixed by a
      <code>"D"</code>.</p>
  <p> Example Doge DID: <code>did:doge:DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L</code>.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3>Implicit Resolution</h3>
  <p> Every Dogecoin address, whether it has a transaction on the public
      Dogecoin blockchain or not, is a valid did:doge by default. If a
      Dogecoin address does not have any did:doge genesis transactions, 
      then a DID resolver MUST generate a default DID Document using the 
      Dogecoin address as its only input into the following template, 
      substituting the input for the placeholder <code>[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]</code>:</p>
  <pre class='example'>
{
    "@context": ["https://w3id.org/did", "https://w3id.org/doge/v1"],
    "id": "did:doge:[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]",
    "publicKey": [
       {
            "id": "did:doge:[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]#wow",
            "controller": "did:doge:[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]",
            "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1RecoverySignature2020",
            "dogecoinAddress": "[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]"
        },
        {
             "id": "did:doge:[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]#vckey-0",
             "controller": "did:doge:[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]",
             "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1RecoverySignature2020",
             "dogecoinAddress": "[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]"
         }
    ],
    "authentication": ["#wow"],
    "assertionMethod": ["#vckey-0"]
}
  </pre>
  <p> A resolver MUST search the Dogecoin public blockchain exhaustively for
      did:doge genesis transactions as part of implicit resolution.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3>did:doge Genesis Transactions</h3>
  <p> To initiate key and service input rotations, a did:doge DID controller
      MUST sign and clear a transaction to the public Dogecoin blockchain
      conforming to the following requirements.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The transaction MUST contain in the <code>scriptSig</code> within the
        <code>txin</code> at index 0 a valid P2PKH unlocking Script with a
        public key corresponding to the did:doge method-specific identifier
        when interpreted as a Dogecoin address.</li>
    <li>The transaction MAY contain other <code>txin</code> entries as
        necessary for paying transaction fees.</li>
    <li>The transaction MUST contain in the <code>scriptPubKey</code> within
        the <code>txout</code> at index 0 a valid P2PKH locking Script with the
        corresponding Dogecoin address's <code>pubKeyHash</code> as the
        recipient, specifically by substituting the
        <code>publicKeyHash</code> for the placeholder
        <code>[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS_PKH]</code> in the Script template:
        <pre class='example'>
OP_DUP
  OP_HASH160
    [DOGECOIN_ADDRESS_PKH]
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_CHECKSIG
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>The transaction MUST contain in the <code>scriptPubKey</code> within
        the <code>txout</code> at index 1 the following Script exactly:
        <pre class='example'>
OP_RETURN OP_PUSHBYTES_49
  5468652054696d65732032372f4a616e2f32303231202744756d62204d6f6e657927204973206f6e2047616d6553746f70
        </pre>
        This unique value is meant to signify an intentful did:doge genesis
        transaction, and has been selected because it has not been used
        previously to this specification's existence.
    </li>
    <li>The transaction MAY contain other <code>txout</code> entries.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> The did:doge genesis transaction is defined as the transaction matching
      the criteria above found on the public Dogecoin blockchain with the
      lowest block height, and in the case of multiple matching transactions
      in the same block, the most preceding transaction in the transaction
      list.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3>did:doge Update Transactions</h3>
  <p> To conduct key and service input rotations using did:doge update
      transactions for a DID, there must exist a corresponding did:doge genesis
      transaction as specified in the previous section. A did:doge update
      transaction MUST be produced in the manner described below and cleared on
      the public Dogecoin blockchain.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The transaction MUST contain in the <code>scriptSig</code> within the
        <code>txin</code> at index 0 a valid P2PKH unlocking Script with a
        public key corresponding to the did:doge method-specific identifier
        when interpreted as a Dogecoin address. Furthermore, the
        <code>txin</code> at index 0 MUST refer to the <code>OutPoint</code> of
        of a valid did:doge genesis transaction or valid did:doge update
        transaction.</li>
    <li>The transaction MAY contain other <code>txin</code> entries as
        necessary for paying transaction fees.</li>
    <li>The transaction MUST contain in the <code>scriptPubKey</code> within
        the <code>txout</code> at index 0 a P2PKH locking Script with the
        next did:doge active keypair's corresponding <code>pubKeyHash</code> as
        the recipient, specifically by substituting the
        <code>publicKeyHash</code> for the placeholder
        <code>[NEXT_ACTIVE_KEY_PKH]</code> in the Script template:
        <pre class='example'>
OP_DUP
  OP_HASH160
    [NEXT_ACTIVE_KEY_PKH]
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_CHECKSIG
        </pre>
        The next did:doge active keypair MAY be the current did:doge active keypair.
    </li>
    <li>The transaction MUST contain in the <code>scriptPubKey</code> within
        the <code>txout</code> at index 1 the following Script template,
        substituing a desired service endpoint URI encoded as hex (no longer
        than 79 bytes) for <code>[SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URI]</code> and the decimal
        length of the URI in bytes for <code>[NUM_BYTES]</code>:
        <pre class='example'>
OP_RETURN OP_PUSHBYTES_[NUM_BYTES] [SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URI]
        </pre>
        If no service endpoint is desired, an empty value MAY be chosen for
        <code>[SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URI]</code>. The <code>OP_RETURN</code>
        instruction MUST be included, otherwise this transaction will be
        considered a did:doge deactivation transaction instead, permanently and
        irreversibly deactivating the DID.
    </li>
    <li>The transaction MAY contain other <code>txout</code> entries.</li>
  </ol>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3>did:doge Deactivation Transactions</h3>
  <p> To deactivate a DID permanently and irreversibly, there must first exist
      a corresponding did:doge genesis transaction as specified in the previous
      section. There MAY also exist did:doge update transactions. To deactivate
      the DID, a deactivation transaction MUST be produced in the manner
      described below and cleared on the public Dogecoin blockchain.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The transaction MUST contain in the <code>scriptSig</code> within the
        <code>txin</code> at index 0 a valid P2PKH unlocking Script with a
        public key corresponding to the did:doge method-specific identifier
        when interpreted as a Dogecoin address. Furthermore, the
        <code>txin</code> at index 0 MUST refer to the <code>OutPoint</code> of
        of a valid did:doge genesis transaction or valid did:doge update
        transaction.</li>
    <li>The transaction MAY contain other <code>txin</code> entries as
        necessary for paying transaction fees.</li>
    <li>The transaction MAY contain other <code>txout</code> entries. However,
	the transaction MUST NOT contain the Script instruction
        <code>OP_RETURN</code> within the <code>scriptPubKey</code> of any of
        its <code>txout</code> entries.
    </li>
  </ol>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3>Additional Terminology</h3>
  <p> The <dfn>following did:doge update transaction</dfn> with respect to a
      did:doge genesis transaction or did:doge update transaction is defined as
      the conforming did:doge update transaction on the public Dogecoin
      blockchain that uses the current transaction's <code>txout</code> at
      index 0 as its <code>txin</code> at index 0.</p>
  <p> The <dfn>did:doge active update transaction</dfn> is the last
      transaction obtained by starting at a did:doge genesis transaction or
      did:doge update transaction and recursively identifying the following
      did:doge update transaction until none exists.</p>
  <p> The <dfn>did:doge active keypair</dfn> is the corresponding keypair to
      the signature produced via private key signing of the did:doge active
      update transaction, or the corresponding keypair to the DID
      method-specific identifier if no update transactions exist.</p>
  <p> The <dfn>did:doge active service endpoint</dfn> is the parameter of
      <code>OP_RETURN</code> in the <code>scriptPubKey</code> of the
      <code>txout</code> at index 1 of the did:doge active update
      transaction, or it is empty if no update transactions exist or the
      <code>OP_RETURN</code> has no following data.</p>

    <h2>Operations</h2>
    <section>
    <h3>Create (Register)</h3>
    <p> Doge DIDs exist per each Dogecoin address by default.</p>
    <p> However, to enable key rotation and specification of a service
        endpoint, the following steps MUST be followed:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ensure no valid did:doge genesis transactions exist.</li>
      <li>Construct a did:doge genesis transaction for desired DID as described
          in Section 2.3.</li>
    </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3>Read (Resolve)</h3>
    <p> To resolve a did:doge DID, the following steps MUST be followed:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Search the public Dogecoin blockchain exhaustively for a did:doge
          genesis transaction as defined in Section 2.3.
      <li>If the did:doge genesis transaction does not exist, then resolve the
          DID document implicitly as specified in 2.2. At this point,
          resolution is considered to be completed successfully and any
          additional steps MUST NOT be followed.</li>
      <li>If the did:doge deactivation transaction exists, then the DID is
          considered deactivated, resolution is considered to be a failure, and
          any additional steps MUST NOT be followed.</li>
      <li>Construct a DID document substituting the Dogecoin address
          corresponding to the did:doge active keypair (as defined in 2.5) in
          the template specified within 2.2.</li>
      <li>If the did:doge active service endpoint exists, define a single
          service endpoint within the DID document, populating the
          <code>id</code> with <code>did:doge:[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]#service</code>
          (where <code>[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]</code> is the Dogecoin address
          corresponding to the method-specific identifier), <code>type</code>
          with <code>DidDogeService</code>, and <code>serviceEndpoint</code> of
          the did:doge active service endpoint.</li>
    </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3>Update (Replace)</h3>
    <p> To update a did:doge DID document, the following steps MUST be
    followed.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ensure that a did:doge genesis transaction exists.</li>
      <li>Construct a did:doge update transaction as described in 2.4
          referencing the did:doge active update transaction, or the did:doge
          genesis transaction if none exists, in its <code>txin</code> at index
          0.</li>
    </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3>Delete (Revoke)</h3>
    <p> To deactivate a did:doge DID, the following steps MUST be followed.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ensure that a did:doge genesis transaction exists.</li>
      <li>Construct a did:doge deactivation transaction as described in 2.5
          referencing the did:doge active update transaction, or the did:doge
          genesis transaction if none exists, in its <code>txin</code> at index
